		The form contains <%= pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") %>
		#The other new idea is the pluralize text helper. It isnâ€™t available in the console by #default, but we can include it explicitly through the ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper 
		#it knows how to pluralize a large number of words, including many with irregular plurals
		#The first method (@user.errors.count)is count, which simply returns the number of errors 
		#error is rails object
