    		#This uses && (logical and) to determine if the resulting user is valid. Taking into account that any object other than nil and false itself is true in a boolean context ,  the if statement is true only if a user with the given email both exists in the database and has the given password, exactly as required.

			render 'new'#without his code below, the sign in button will return an error.Letâ€™s start by defining a minimalist create action for the Sessions controller (Listing 8.9), which does nothing but render the new view. Submitting the /sessions/new form with blank fields then yields the result
